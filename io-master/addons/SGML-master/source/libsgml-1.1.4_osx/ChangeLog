1.1.4 -- March 25, 2003

	* Bug fix in base 64 decoding that could lead to heap corruption.

1.1.3 -- January 17, 2003

	* Bug fix for attributes with single quotes in them.  Thanks to Tom Rogers for reporting it.
	  There is still a problem related to attr='test"ing'.  The parsing works fine, but if you were to
	  output the same text it would look like attr="test"ing".  This is due to the fact that libsgml
	  turns dirty sgml into 'clean' sgml at a certain expense.  If this is a requested feature I
	  think I could add some stuff to allow libsgml to track attribute value quoting.

1.1.2 -- December 9, 2002

	* Added variant getters and setters for attributes and node values.

1.1.1 -- December 1, 2002

	* Added install and uninstall make targets
	* Added C++ compatibility (oversight)

1.1.0 -- December 1, 2002

	!!! NOTE !!!

		Version 1.1.0 is not backwards compatible with 1.0.0.  I apologize for this,
		but in the interest of size and code reuse I've had to make this change.

	!!! NOTE !!!

	* Added support for XML parsing into a DOM tree.
	* Generalized DOM structures for reuse between XML and HTML.
	* Added serialization to files, file descriptors and strings.
	* Documented with doxygen.

1.0.0 -- September 30, 2002

	* Initial release.
