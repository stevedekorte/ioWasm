v1.0 Purpose
------------
 - A real project using Io
	- Helps Io stabilise
		- Lots of bugs in Io will be fixed along the way
		- Identify areas where Io is weak
 - Simple diagramming tool
	- possibly for brain storming sessions
 - Diagrams for on-screen display rather than print display
 - Create the ground work for a shareware app
 - A quick success

v1.0 Principles
---------------
 - Dead simple interface
 - Short time frame
 - Iterative/Multiple versions (v1.0, v2.0, v3.0...)
 - Any profits are split evenly
 - 

Vision
------
 - A cool little on-screen diagramming tool which in an iteration or two will be
	 sold as a small shareware app.
 - Many small advancements made to Io.
 - Io in better shape than it is now.
 - Aware of more deficiencies in Io.
