## Docker for Io Language

Developed while pursuing 7 Languages in 7 Weeks. This image should provide a reusable 'environment' for development with Io.

Naturally this depends on docker, so you'll need it installed before this will be useful. Afterwards, you should be able to run the two shell scripts to built and then run the container.

## Looking towards the future

In Theory this image could be used as the basis for future, more useful Io containers, that you could import your own projects into.

In practice it might be good to add this Image to Docker Hub, if it proves sufficiently useful, with tags to enable users to leverage specific tags. That would allow us to ease the initiation of new developers into the language.
